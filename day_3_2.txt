We have to draw 2 cards from a pack of 52 cards without replacement.

Let E be the event that both the cards are of same suit.

For the first card, any card of any suite can be chosen.

Thus,

P(drawing 1st card): 1 ---> a

Let the first card drawn belong to suite X.

Remaining cards in suite X: 12 

(as every suite contains 13 cards and 1 is already drawn)

Remaining cards in deck: 51

Therefore,

P(drawing 2nd card from same suite X): 12/51 ---> b

Now,

P(E)= a*b= 1*12/51 = 12/51

Answer is 12/51.
